		<h4>The meeting with Newell's Old Boys will please not only Messi, but also Gerardo Martino. The Inter coach has almost 500 appearances for the club</h4>
		<p>Inter announced that the meeting with Newell's Old Boys will take place on February 15, 2024 - approximately a couple of weeks before the start of the new MLS competition.</p>
		<p>Newell's Old Boys are based in Rosario, the hometown of Leo Messi and Inter Miami head coach Gerardo Martino. The club is no stranger to both: 13-year-old Messi moved from there to the Barcelona academy, and Martino played almost 500 matches and coached him from 2012 to 2013.</p>
		<p>In the summer, Messi already traveled to his homeland for the farewell match of Maxi Rodriguez - he both started and ended his career at Newell's Old Boys. Leo played for Argentina and celebrated his 36th birthday with a half-time hat-trick.</p>
